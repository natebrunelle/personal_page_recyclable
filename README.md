This is a repository intended for others to copy in order to get a jump start on their own web pages.

To use this tool I recommend that you have a linux terminal (e.g. WSL) or some other way to run bash scripts. You will also need pandocs for converting from markdown to html, and python3 installed.

Workflow: Make the changes you would like inside source/markdown. Then run the bash script update.sh. That's it!
