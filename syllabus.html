      <p>For communication about course content, Discord is preferred to email. For communication about personal circumstances, email or Discord DMs are preferred. If you email, include either <q>algorithms</q> or <q>4102</q> in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping my inbox and never getting read.</p>
      <p>Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don’t put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.</p>
      <h2 id="readings"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Readings</h2>
      <p>There is no required textbook for this class. If you would like to consult a text to reinforce your learning, we recommend:</p>
      <p><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>, Third Edition by Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0262033844). UVA Library makes a digital version of our textbook <a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775">available online</a>.</p>
      <p>Readings corresponding to each lecture will be posted on the course schedule.</p>
      <h2 id="lectures"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Lectures</h2>
      <p>I do my best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the <a href="schedule.html">course webpage</a>. Although we believe nearly all students will benefit from attending all classes, we also respect that as mature (ideally) college students, you are entrusted to figure out how best to learn and make use of your time here. Hence, I will not assess attendance or impose any penalties for missing class. I will make a best effort to post all lecture materials (recordings, slides documents, etc.) on the course webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, and even when they do succeed these recordings may not be an adequate substitute for attending class live.</p>
      <h2 id="tasks"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Tasks</h2>
      <p>You will be expected to read instructional material and either understand it or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet daily to discuss readings, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.</p>
      <p>You will be asked to perform three kinds of evaluations:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Quizzes</strong>: Open-resource assessments of your understanding of broad course topics. These are intended to verify that you develop and maintain an intuitive understanding of the course concepts. These must be completed independently.</li>
      <li><strong>Little Problem Sets</strong>: Problems for you to solve. These may require that you design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are designed to provide opportunities for you to develop working familiarity with course concepts. <q>Whiteboard-only</q> collaboration with a small work group of up to 6 people (yourself plus 5) is encouraged. These problem sets are short, and the tasks are more <q>bite-sized</q> in that they’re expected to be completable in 1-2 sittings.</li>
      <li><strong>Big Problem Sets</strong>: Problems for you to solve. These may require that you design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are meant to provide opportunities for you exercise and hone your skills with course concepts. If you choose to belong to a cohort, you will construct one collaborative submission for your entire cohort. If you are not in a cohort, <q>Whiteboard-only</q> collaboration with a small work group of up to 6 people (yourself plus 5) is encouraged. These problem sets are longer, and the tasks typically require deeper insight than those on the little problem sets. You are given longer to do them mostly to allow you time for more sittings. I suggest working on the problems in multiple 1-2 hours sessions, rather than trying to <q>cram</q> a solution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that there are no graded in-class activities, and no traditional exams. In lieue of a final exam you will instead have a last <q>Big Problem Set</q> due.</p>
      <h1 id="grading"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Grading</h1>
      <p>In February 2019 the CS faculty approved <a href="http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html">a definition</a> of what we believe grades mean. It is my intent to approximate that definition in this course. As a brief summary,</p>

      <p><strong>Rounding:</strong> By default, grades will not be rounded in this course.</p>
      <p>This numerical calculation is to be considered a <strong>guideline</strong> on your score in the course. Final letter grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials. I expect that qualitative adjustments will only result in a student’s grade increasing (though in extreme and rare circumstances I reserve the right to decrease grades).</p>
      <h2 id="deadlines"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Deadlines</h2>
      <p>Deadlines for all assignments are available on the <a href="schedule.html">schedule page</a>. In general, for any give week’s content, expect to have 3 <q>little</q> assignments due during the week, 1 quiz due at the end of the week, and 1 <q>big</q> assignment due at the start of the next week. There are a few exceptions to this pattern, so please make sure you check the schedule.</p>
      <p>Due to the rapid pace of summer courses, late submissions of assignments will not be allowed by default. If you feel that extenuating circumstances justify late submission for any assignment, please request a deadline extension. You can do that on the same page where you would submit an assignment. There is no upper bound on the number of assignment extensions you may be granted, but please don’t exploit this.</p>
      <h2 id="regrades"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Regrades</h2>
      <p>We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people, and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on assignments within 48 hours of your grade being returned.</p>
      <p>For <strong>problem sets</strong> (both <strong>big</strong> and <strong>little</strong>), please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission. In your request, identify specifically what in your submission demonstrates the misapplication. If you submitted the big assignment as a cohort, only the original submitter should request the regrade.</p>
      <p>The goal of <strong>quizzes</strong> is to help you to form a better conceptual understanding of course materials, and therefore we consider them primarily as an opportunity to identify and correct misconceptions. For this reason, you may submit one regrade request per quiz to <em>revise</em> your answers.</p>
      <h1 id="miscellanea"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Miscellanea</h1>
      <h2 id="pledge"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Pledge</h2>
      <p>All students of CS4102 are expected to abide by the <a href="pledge.html">course pledge</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="professionalism"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Professionalism</h2>
      <p>Behave professionally.</p>
      <p>Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes. Kindness is more important than correctness (and I have in the past adjusted grades both up and down to reflect this ethos).</p>
      <p>Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.</p>
      <p>Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.</p>
      <h2 id="honesty"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Honesty</h2>
      <p>I always hope everyone will behave honestly. I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not; if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.</p>
      <h3 id="no-plagiarism-nor-anything-like-it"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> No plagiarism (nor anything like it)</h3>
      <p><strong>Quizzes</strong>: You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The course textbook</li>
      <li>Anything on the course webpage or directly linked to from the course webpage</li>
      <li>Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)</li>
      <li>Lecture recordings</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Little Problem Sets</strong>: You may collaborate with up to 5 other people (i.e. a group of up to 6 total), but your collaboration must be <q>Whiteboard-Only</q> (defined below). Your writeup must be composed completely individually.</p>
      <p><strong>Big Problem Sets</strong>: You may either produce a singular collaborative submission with your cohort or else you may compose and submit an individual writeup. If you are submitting an individual writeup, you may collaborate with up to 5 other people (i.e. a group of up to 6 total), but your collaboration must be <q>Whiteboard-Only</q> (defined below).</p>
      <p>For either kind of problem set (big or little) you may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.</li>
      <li>You <strong>must</strong> cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your/your cohort’s own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: <q>I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted  for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code.</q></li>
      <li>Do not seek <q>hints</q> or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="whiteboard-only-collaboration"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1.1</span> Whiteboard Only Collaboration</h4>
      <p><q>Whiteboard Only</q> collaboration is meant to convey the type of discussion where participants gather around a whiteboard to solve a problem together, without taking any notes from their discussion, and then erasing the whiteboard before they disperse.</p>
      <p>In particular, you may discuss problems and solutions, but the only thing you may take away from your discussion is your brain. This means you may not produce any records or artifacts from your collaborations, including: notes, screenshots, photos, figures, audio/video recordings, documents (inluding google docs), links, or any other digital or tangible thing. Nor may you share any files, links, etc. with other students outside of a collaboration session. Any substantially similar expression of the same solution can only occur if collaboration extends beyond <q>whiteboard only</q>, and so will be considered as evidence of a policy violation.</p>
      <h3 id="consequences-of-dishonesty"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Consequences of Dishonesty</h3>
      <p>If I believe you have acted dishonestly, I will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty. If you have information I lack, please share that with me; I may thereafter change my belief and/or proposed penalty.</p>
      <h2 id="personal-accommodations"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Personal accommodations</h2>
      <h3 id="special-circumstances"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Special Circumstances</h3>
      <p>The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting <a href="http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">their website</a>. For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably during the <strong>first week of class</strong>.</p>
      <h3 id="religious-observances"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Religious observances</h3>
      <p>It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the <a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance">University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)</a> at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.</p>
      <h3 id="safe-environment"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Safe Environment</h3>
      <p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
      <li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">UVA Sexual Violence website</a> that describes reporting options and resources available. As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf">Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds</a>. The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</p>
      <h3 id="life"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Life</h3>
      <p>Bad things happen. People forget things and make mistakes. Bad days coincide with due dates. Etc.</p>
      <p>If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we’ll resolve the situation as best we can.</p>
      <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.</p>
